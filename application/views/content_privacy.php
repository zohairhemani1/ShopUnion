                you submit to us when you sign up for our Services. Rest assured, we will never

                        When you sign up with us, you give us certain personal information (your name, password,
                        and email) as well as your business information (name, address, phone number, and
                        website). Your personal information is always kept private, donâ€™t worry. We may
                        use your email address to send you feature updates and communication, but will keep
                        it to a minimum. Your business information becomes public as soon as you make your
                        first post on Shopunion. By public, we mean that anyone that has the Shopunion app
                        can view your business information. You can always edit your business or personal
                        information on your account page.</p>

                            www.pushlocal.tumblr.com</a>, meaning anyone with an internet connection anywhere
