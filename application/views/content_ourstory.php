                        When we first had the idea for Shopunion, we wanted to <strong>connect communities.</strong>
                        We decided the best way to do that was to focus on helping the local organizations
                        effectively communicate with their supporters – in this case, us!</p>

                        chosen Shopunion as a way to build and connect their communities by communicating
                        directly with the local supporters who care about them.

                Shopunion is the first platform that gives every single organization in a city it’s
                <strong>"own" mobile</strong> app and funnels the information to one place for easy

                People are busy. They have crazy lives. They care about their communities, but often
                don’t have the time to search the internet for the information that would allow
                them to act. We wanted to make sure that information was at their fingertips.</p>

                    How We Succeed</h2>
                <h4>
                    At Shopunion, we take a personal, bottom-up approach to growth.</h4>
            </hgroup>
            <p>
                Before we launch in any city, we partner with a local entrepreneur who licenses
                our platform and will "own" Shopunion in that city. This gives us several distinct
                advantages over larger players in the local/social/marketing space:</p>
            <ul class="listTwo">
                <li><strong>We personally onboard, train, and support each of our clients. </strong>
                    <p>
                        When there is a problem, there is a local representative ready to answer any questions
                        our clients may have. We want to make every single client successful on our platform.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>To DO local, you have to BE local.</strong>
                    <p>
                        Our partners are members of their Chambers of Commerce, run local businesses, and
                        have children who attend local schools, churches, and sports leagues. Understanding
                        the intricacies of their respective communities is crucial to Shopunion’s success.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>We create wealth and empower entrepreneurs.</strong>
                    <p>
                        We share the majority of the revenue with our local partner in each city. This allows
                        each partner to concentrate on Shopunion as a viable business and really buy in
                        to the Shopunion idea. These days, everyone wants to create their own startup -
                        Shopunion makes it possible for someone without technical expertise to own their
                        own tech-centric business.</p>
